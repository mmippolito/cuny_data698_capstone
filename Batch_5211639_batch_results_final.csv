Netflix and YouTube make up half of the peak internet traffic in North America.<br />agent_2: That is crazy, and I think it will even continue to grow in the future. <br />agent_1: Netflix is worth $2 billion right now.<br />agent_2: Wow, I think back in 2000, they proposed to Blockbuster that it should use Netflix as it&#x27;s online service, they laughed at the offer. <br />agent_1: I bet lol. Netflix was started due to a $40 late fee incurred by Reed Hastings.<br />agent_2: Yeah old Reed didn&#x27;t like those late fees, look what happened since then. <br />agent_1: Do you like Tom Cruise?<br />agent_2: Yeah I do, I really like 80&#x27;s Tom Cruise movies.
