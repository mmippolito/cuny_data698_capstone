UserB: Traveling the world
UserA: I would travel the world, go scuba diving, and maybe explore places I've never been before.
UserB: Where would you go to first?
UserA: I would probably go to Saipan. It's a place in the Marianna Islands that has some really cool scuba sites with WWII wrecks. What about you?
UserB: I would go to Korea first because my really old great grandma lives there and I want to visit her
UserA: That's cool that you're part Korean! Have you been there before?
UserB: I have I was actually just there about 2 years ago Have you traveled abroad before?
UserA: Yeah I've actually spent half of my life living in China. I traveled around Asia a lot while I was there.
UserB: That's so cool! I would love to travel around Asia
UserA: When I was young, I spent an Easter in Korea with some cousins. I don't remember it very well, but I remember Korea being very clean.
UserB: It is. My mom and sister spent a month or so in China and afterwards they came to Korea and they said it was much cleaner
UserA: I lived in Shanghai and a city called Chong Qing. Shanghai is significantly cleaner because there are a ton of foreigners there.
UserB: That makes sense. My roommate is from Shanghai!
UserA: Really? That's really cool. Is she Chinese?
UserB: Yeah, she's here for ESL classes
