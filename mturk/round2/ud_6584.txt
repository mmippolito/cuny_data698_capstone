aanonymouss: In order to run VNC (like vino, remote desktop) do I need to have a video card installed?  I booted up w/o vid card and I can ssh into the box but cannot vnc in and it seems like x11 applications aren't running
fryguy: you'll need to run XvFB or something
fryguy: or forward through a different X server via X11 forwarding or xdmcp
aanonymouss: thanks I'll look into that
aanonymouss: any idea why x11 apps aren't running?
fryguy: you can't run X apps without an X server, and you can't run the X server that is configured out of the box in ubuntu without a video display
aanonymouss: would it change anything if I originally setup the box with x11 running and had everything running, then ripped out my gfx card and now am trying to run everything?
fryguy: no
aanonymouss: so if there's no video card, x server wont start?
fryguy: the one out of the box in ubuntu won't, which is why you should look into XvFB or another X server, or just run the X server on another machine
